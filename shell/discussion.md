## Other Shells

Before Bash became popular in the end of nineties,
scientists widely used (and some still use) another shell, C-shell, or Csh.
Bash and Csh have similar feature sets,
but their syntax rules are different and this makes them incompatible with each other.
A few other shells have appeared since,
including ksh, zsh, and a number of others;
they are mostly compatible with Bash,
and Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix
(including most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows)
but if you get strange errors in shell scripts written by colleagues,
check to see which shell they were written for.
