If pwd displays /users/thing, what will ls ../backup display?
```
1. ../backup: No such file or directory
2. 2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27
3. 2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/
4. original pnas_final pnas_sub
```

If pwd displays /users/fly, what command will display
```
1. thesis/ papers/ articles/
2. ls pwd
3. ls -r -F
4. ls -r -F /users/fly
5. Either #2 or #3 above, but not #1.
```

What does the command cd without a directory name do?

1. It has no effect.
2. It changes the working directory to /.
3. It changes the working directory to the user's home directory.
4. It is an error.

We said earlier that spaces in path names have to be marked with a leading backslash in order for the shell to interpret them properly. Why? What happens if we run a command like:

```$ ls my\ thesis\ files```
without the backslashes?
