## Why Version Control?

Using a software tool to handle the versions of your project files
lets you focus on the more interesting/innovative aspects of your project

## Version Control Features

*   It's easy to set up
*   Every copy of a Git repository is a full backup of a project and its history
*   A few easy-to-remember commands are all you need for most day-to-day version control tasks
*   The [GitHub](https://github.com/) hosting service provides a web-based collaboration service

## Two main concepts

*   *commit*: a recorded set of changes in your project's file
*   *repository*: the history of all your project's commits

## Why Use Github?

*   No need for a server: easy to set up
*   GitHub's strong community: your colleagues are probably already there
